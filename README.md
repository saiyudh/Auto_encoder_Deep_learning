# Auto_encoder_Deep_learning
creating custom Auto_encoder with Tensor flow Deep_learning

## Goal
The goal of this project is to analyse the accuracy of autoencoders and convulational autoencoders over the MNIST dataset

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of python and Tensor flow and building custom models in Tensor flow.  

## Description
Auto encoder vs Convulational Auto Encoder.

## Implementation
Implementing custom models Auto Encoder and Convulational Auto Encoders.

## Results
The visualization shows how Autoencoders predicted the numbers from MNIST test data set. 

## Credits
Introduction to Deep learning, OVGU(Otto Von Guericke Course) course
